-- hse BCs with temperature or density constant look about the same,
   but it is important that the velocity be reflected.

   For some reason, outflow with HSE causes the density to change
   dramatically

   Also, pure reflecting BCs (i.e. no HSE support) cause sharp jumps
   right at the boundaries.

-- for a constant entropy envelope, the solution looks like:

   rho^{gamma-1} = rho_c^{gamma-1} + g (gamma-1)/gamma R /K

   (where K is the constant in the EOS).

   Since g < 0, the RHS has a zero.  This puts a limit on the range 
   that we can model, because we cannot resolve past the edge of the 
   star.

   Perhaps we should switch back to a isothermal EOS at the edge?
