-- hse BCs with temperature or density constant look about the same,
   but it is important that the velocity be reflected.

   For some reason, outflow with HSE causes the density to change
   dramatically

   Also, pure reflecting BCs (i.e. no HSE support) cause sharp jumps
   right at the boundaries.
