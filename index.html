<P><H2>Introduction</H2>

<p>hydro1d is meant as a teaching code&mdash;written to help new
Astronomy / Astrophysics undergraduate and graduate students come up
to speed on the methods for solving the equations of hydrodynamics
that are popular in our field.

<p>hydro1d solves the compressible Euler equations in a
finite-volume Godunov framework.  A simple gamma-law gas is used.
Slopes are reconstructed using piecewise constant (Godunov), piecewise
linear, or piecewise parabolic (PPM) polynomials.  <em>The emphasis in
the code is on readability and understanding the equations</em>, so
some steps are explicitly written out for clarity&mdash;performance is
a secondary consideration.

<p>The code is written in Fortran (using some elements of Fortran 2003
and 2008).  The included makefile is setup for gfortran.


<p>Some basic problems are supplied, including a shock-tube (in
the <tt>sod/</tt> directory), and simple advection (<tt>advect/</tt>)
of a density pulse.  The included <tt>README</tt> file explains how
to get started.


<P><H2>Notes</H2>

<p>Some notes on the piecewise linear and piecewise parabolic methods
for the Euler equations are available
here: <a href="http://bender.astro.sunysb.edu/hydro_by_example/CompHydroTutorial.pdf">CompHydroTutorial.pdf</a>

<p>For a 2-d hydrodynamics code (written mostly in python) written
as a teaching code, see the <a href="http://bender.astro.sunysb.edu/hydro_by_example/">pyro2 code webpage</a>

implements unsplit ppm, download the <a href="https://ccse.lbl.gov/Downloads/downloadCASTRO.html">Castro Code</a>
