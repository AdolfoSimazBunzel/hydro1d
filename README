hydro1d (M. Zingale, 2012-03-06)

hydro1d is a simple 1-d, gamma-law gas hydrodynamics code for teaching
purposes.  Piecewise constant (Godunov), piecewise linear, and
piecewise parabolic (PPM) reconstruction is implemented.  

Individual problems are built in subdirectories (e.g. sod/).  Type
'make' there to build the source.  Object files and modules will be
output into the _build subdirectory.  'make realclean' will clean up
the objects.  Things are setup for gfortran by default -- you will
need to edit the Ghydro.mak with different options for different
compilers.

A number of runtime options can be specified -- look in params.f90 for
the available runtime parameters.  These are set in a namelist in the
inputs file.  Problems can specify their own runtime parameters (with
a probparams.f90 in the problem directory).  These have a separate
namelist in the same inputs file.  See the sod problem for examples.
